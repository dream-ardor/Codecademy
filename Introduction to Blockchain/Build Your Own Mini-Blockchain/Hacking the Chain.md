BUILD YOUR OWN MINI-BLOCKCHAIN!

Hacking the Chain

Now we can use the code in our previous exercise to spot a broken link. Letâ€™s try tampering with the contents of the block and see how that creates a mismatch between hash values.

**Instructions:**

Instantiate a new Blockchain object called my_blockchain.

Add a new block to my_blockchain and pass in new_transactions as the argument.

Print out the contents of my_blockchain to see the new block!

Select the transactions found in my_blockchain's chain attribute. Set the transactions variable of Block 1 to the string "fake_transactions".

Now let's check if the blockchain is still valid by calling the correct method on my_blockchain!

**Solution:**
```python
from blockchain import Blockchain

new_transactions = [{'amount': '30', 'sender':'alice', 'receiver':'bob'},
               	{'amount': '55', 'sender':'bob', 'receiver':'alice'}]


my_blockchain = Blockchain()
my_blockchain.add_block(new_transactions)
my_blockchain.print_blocks()
my_blockchain.chain[1].transactions = 'fake_transactions'
my_blockchain.validate_chain()
```
