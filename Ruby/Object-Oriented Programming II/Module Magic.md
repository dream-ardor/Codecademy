Super. Let's move on to modules!

**Instructions:**
Create your own module called Languages in the editor to the right. Include a constant called FAVE and set it equal to a string naming your favorite programming language!

**My Code:**
```ruby
# Create your module below!
module Languages
  FAVE = "Ruby"
end
```
