OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING II

A Matter of Public Knowledge

All right! Let's do a little practice with public methods.

**Instructions:**
We've set up an Application class in the editor. Add a public method called print_status to Application that puts "All systems go!". Don't forget to use the public keyword!

**My Code:**
```ruby
class Application
  attr_accessor :status
  def initialize; end
  # Add your method here!
  public 
  def print_status
    puts "All systems go!"
  end
end
```
