BLOCKS, PROCS, AND LAMBDAS

Been Around the Block a Few Times

You're basically a Ruby block master at this point. This should be pretty easy!

**Instructions:**
The odds_n_ends array is full of all sorts of objects, but we only want the integers (numbers without decimal bits).

Create a new variable, ints, and store the result of calling odds_n_ends.select method with a block that checks if the element .is_a? Integer.

puts ints at the end of the file in order to see the final contents of the array.

**My Code:**
```ruby
odds_n_ends = [:weezard, 42, "Trady Blix", 3, true, 19, 12.345]

ints = odds_n_ends.select { |x| x.is_a? Integer }

puts ints
```
