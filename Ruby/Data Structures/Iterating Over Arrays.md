DATA STRUCTURES

Iterating Over Arrays

Iterating over arrays is easier than it looks.
```Ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.each { |element| puts element }
```
In the example above, we create an array called numbers with 5 elements.
Then we say, "Take this array and for each element, print it to the console." As usual, we can use any placeholder name for the bit between two | | characters.
**Instructions:**
Use the .each iterator to puts out each element of the languages array.

Make sure to use puts instead of print, so each element is on its own line.

**My Code:**
```Ruby
languages = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]

languages.each { |element| puts element}
```
