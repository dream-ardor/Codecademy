THE ZEN OF RUBY

One-Liners

All right! Time to put your new knowledge to work by refactoring some existing code. Refactoring is just a fancy way of saying we're improving the structure or appearance of our code without changing what it actually does.

We won't cover every bit of syntax from the previous exercises, but we'll hit the highlights. Ready?

**Instructions:**
Refactor the contents of the editor to just one line of code.

**My Code:**
```ruby
if 1 < 2
  puts "One is less than two!"
end

#refactored below
 puts "One is less than two!" if 1 < 2
```
