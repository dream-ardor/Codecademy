THE ZEN OF RUBY

Implicit Return

Next up: let's simplify our method madness by removing unnecessary returns from our code.

**Instructions:**
Write a method, square, that takes a number as an argument and implicitly returns the square of that number.

**My Code:**
```ruby
def square(number)
  number*number
end
```
