THE ZEN OF RUBY

The Ternary Operator

Good! Let's make our code even more streamlined using the ternary operator.
```ruby
three = 3
puts three == 3 ? "Of course." : "What?"
# ==> puts "Of course."
```
The example above is just a syntax reminder.

**Instructions:**
Refactor the if statement in the editor to use a ternary operator to puts the correct sentence.

**My Code:**
```ruby
puts 1 < 2 ? "One is less than two!" : "One is not less than two."
```
