THE ZEN OF RUBY

'For' Shame!

All right! Last one: let's do something about the decidedly un-Ruby for loop in the editor.
```ruby
10.times do
  puts "Knock knock."
  puts "Who's there?"
end
```
**Instructions:**
Let's finish up by refactoring the for loop on the right to use .times instead.

**My Code:**
```ruby
3.times do
  puts "I'm a refactoring master!"
end
```
