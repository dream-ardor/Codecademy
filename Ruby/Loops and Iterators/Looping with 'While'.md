LOOPS & ITERATORS

Looping with 'While'

Okay, training wheels off. Let's see your stuff!
```Ruby
i = 3
while i > 0 do
  print i
  i -= 1
end
```
In the above example, we create a variable called i and set it to 3.
Then, we print out 321 since we execute the loop as long as i is positive.

**Instructions:**
Use a while loop to print out the numbers 1 through 50, inclusive. While the example above counts down, you will want to count up.Use print rather than puts, and don't forget to increment your variable.

**My Code:**
```Ruby
i = 1
while i < 51 do
  print i
   i += 1
end
```
