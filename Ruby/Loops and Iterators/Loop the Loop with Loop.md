LOOPS & ITERATORS

Loop the Loop with Loop

Great work! We'll give you a bit of a break from the numbers game.
```Ruby
m = 0
loop do
  m += 1
  print m
  break if m == 10
end
```
In the example above, we print out 12345678910 since we loop 10 times.

**Instructions:**
Use the loop iterator to print out the string "Ruby!" 30 times.

Make sure to type the string exactly as shown!

**My Code:**
```Ruby
i = 0
loop do
  i += 1
  print "Ruby!"
  break if i == 30
end
```
