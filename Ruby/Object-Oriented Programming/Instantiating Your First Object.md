OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING I

Instantiating Your First Object

Perfect! Now we're ready to start creating objects.

We can create an instance of a class just by calling .new on the class name, like so:
```ruby
me = Person.new("Eric")
```
**Instructions:**
Create a variable, matz, and set it equal to calling .new on your Person class. Pass .new the name "Yukihiro" as its only argument.

**My Code:**
```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

matz = Person.new("Yukihiro")
```
