METHODS, BLOCKS, & SORTING

Create Your Own

Now it's time for you to build your own method. Remember, the syntax looks like this:
```Ruby
def method_name
  # Do something!
end
```
**Instructions:**
Create a method, greeting, in the editor. It should use puts to print a greeting to the console.

**My Code:**
```Ruby
# Define your method below!
def greeting
  puts "I am the best!"
end




# Define your method above this line.

greeting # Ignore this for now. We'll explain
         # it in the next exercise!
```
