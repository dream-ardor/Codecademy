METHODS, BLOCKS, & SORTING

Basic Methods

Let's quickly review how to create a basic Ruby method.
```Ruby
def double(n)
  return n * 2
end
```
The example above is just a syntax reminder.

**Instructions:**
Create a method, welcome, that puts "Welcome to Ruby!" After defining your method, call it.

**My Code:**
```Ruby
def welcome
  return "Welcome to Ruby!"
end
puts welcome
```
