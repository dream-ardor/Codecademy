METHODS, BLOCKS, & SORTING

Let's Learn Return

Sometimes we don't just want a method to print something to the console, but we actually want that method to hand us (or another method!) back a value. For that, we use return.
```Ruby
def double(n)
  return n * 2
end

output = double(6)
output += 2
puts output
```

In the example above, we define a new method called double that accepts one argument called n.
Inside the method, we return two times n.
After that, we call our new double method with an argument of 6 and store the result, 12, in output.
Then, we increase output to 14 and print it out to the console.
**Instructions:**
Define a new method called add that takes two numbers as arguments.

Inside the method, return the sum of those numbers.

**My Code:**
```Ruby
def add(n,n1)
  return n + n1
end
```
