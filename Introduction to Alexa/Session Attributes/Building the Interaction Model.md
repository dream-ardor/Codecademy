Building the Interaction Model

Before we build the Lambda function logic for our flashcards skill, we want to build the interaction model.

To do so, weâ€™ll navigate to developer.amazon.com and use the Alexa Skill Builder. If you are unfamiliar with this process or need a refresher, check out these videos: how to create a skill and how to build an interaction model.

Create an interaction model
* Add a custom slot named languages with the following slot values: ruby, python, javascript.
* Add a custom slot named answer with the following slot values: length, len, print, puts, console.log, capitalized, lowercase.
* Create a custom intent named SetMyLanguageIntent
* Add the following utterances to SetMyLanguageIntent: Test my {languages} knowledge and Practice {languages}
* Create a custom intent named AnswerIntent
* Add the following utterances to AnswerIntent: I think it's {answer} and Is it {answer}
