Testing with the Service Simulator

Now that we’ve completed our skill, let’s test it out. We’ve included our version of the service simulator to let you see how requests and responses should appear.

Try out the following utterances in order:

* Open Codecademy Flashcards
* Test my Ruby knowledge
* Is it length
* Exit

Then, simulate “re-opening” the skill by making a call to the LaunchRequest again.

* Open Codecademy Flashcards
* Test my Ruby knowledge
* I think it's puts
* Exit

You will notice a different response when you open Codecademy Flashcards the second time.

**Instructions:**
* Try testing out the different utterances from our skill. Pay attention to the text highlighted in red, such as session attributes.
* Now test it on the developer.amazon.com site and see if your skill is functioning as expected. You can find the session simulator under your skill's Test tab.
