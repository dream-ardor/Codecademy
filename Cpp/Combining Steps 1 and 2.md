VARIABLES

Combining Step 1 and Step 2

You can both declare and assign a value to a variable in a single initialization statement.

Suppose we have these two lines:
```
// Declare a variable
int score;

// Initialize a variable
score = 0;
```
We can actually combine these two lines into a single line of code:
```
int score = 0;
```
This means we are declaring an integer called score and setting it equal to 0.

Combining the two steps.

Note: You only need to declare a variable one time!

**Instructions:**
In your program, declare and initialize an int variable named year and initialize its value as 2019.

**My Code:**
```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {

   int score = 0;
   
   // Declare and initialize a variable here
   int year = 2019;
   
   return 0;
   
}
```
