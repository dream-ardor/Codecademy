## FUNCTIONS

### Void â€” The Point of No Return

Let's build a simple function with no input and no output. We can do that?

Enter the void specifier, which is added in the function declaration before the function name. A void function, also known as a subroutine, has no return value, making it ideally suited for situations where you just want to print stuff to the terminal.

For example:
```c++
void animal_chat() {

  std::string fav, pet;

  std::cout << "What's your favorite animal?\n";
  std::cin >> fav;

  std::cout << "Do you have a " << fav << " as a pet? y/n\n";
  std::cin >> pet;

  if (pet == "y") {

    std::cout << "How lucky you have a " << fav << " as a pet!\n";

  } else {

    std::cout << "That's too bad.\n";

  }

}
```
The above chat program is built to capture user responses and print to the terminal without returning any values.

### Instructions

Above main(), define a void function oscar_wilde_quote() that prints "The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography." to the output terminal.

Inside of main(), call oscar_wilde_quote().

## My Code
```c++
#include <iostream>

// Define oscar_wilde_quote() below:
void oscar_wilde_quote() {
  std::cout << "The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\n";
}

int main() {
  
  // Call your function here:
  oscar_wilde_quote();
  
}
```
