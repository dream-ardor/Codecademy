## FUNCTIONS

### Return Types â€” Beyond the Void

When you do in fact want your function to return something and pass information back to the rest of your program, C++ has you covered. Just like there are many variable types, there are many different return types for functions.

A function can return most data types we've covered, including double, int, bool, char, std::string, and std::vector.
```c++
std::string always_blue() {

  return "blue!\n";

}
```
Note: The return statement is the last line the function will execute. For example:
```c++
std::string always_blue() {

  return "blue!\n";
  std::cout << "Returned blue!";

}
```
The final line will not execute because a value has already been returned. So nothing will be printed to the terminal.

### Instructions

Convert needs_it_support from a void function into a bool type function.

Instead of printing support at the end of the function body, return support from the function.

Inside of main(), print the result of needs_it_support() to the terminal.

## My Code
```c++
#include <iostream>

// Change needs_it_support so that it returns support:
bool needs_it_support() {
  
  bool support;
  
  std::cout << "Hello. IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? Enter 'true' for yes, 'false' for no.\n";
  std::cin >> support;
  return support;
  
}

int main() {
  
  // Change the following line to print the function result:
 std::cout << needs_it_support();
  
}
```
