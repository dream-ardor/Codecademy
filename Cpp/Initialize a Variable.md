Step 2: Initialize a Variable

After you declare a variable, you can give it a value!

Suppose that you have an int variable called score, to set it to 0:
```C++
score = 0;
```
The score is the name of the variable.
The = means assign.
The 0 is the value you want to give.
Note: In C++, a single equal sign = does not really mean "equal". It means "assign". In the code above, we are assigning the score variable a value of 0.

**Instructions:**
Inside the variable.cpp file, you have declared an int variable named year.

Let's give the variable a value of 2019.

**My Code:**
```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  // Declare a variable   
  int year;
  
  // Initialize a variable
  year = 2019;
   
}
```
