## Instructions
As a final send off, do you remember you wrote a letter in the first lesson of the course? Well, here it is! ðŸ“¨

You have come a long way and you should be very very proud of yourself. Canâ€™t wait to see the things you build.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
  
  std::cout << "Dear Self,\n";
  std::cout << "Keep on being a bad ass and keep dominating. You are the greatest.\n";
  std::cout << "Monday 12/17/2018" ; 
  
  
  
  
}
```
