## HELLO WORLD

### Run Some C#

Time to run some C# yourself!

There are two panels here: a text editor containing some C# code and a console, or terminal, that shows output. When you run the code, you’ll see some text printed to the console.

The code is contained in a file called Program.cs. For now, just focus on the line: 
```c#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
Console.WriteLine() is a command that prints text to a console. Whatever is in between the parentheses will be printed to the console!  In this case it’s Hello World!.

## Instructions

Change the text to print your own name to the console!

## My Code
```c#
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello Dan!");    
     }
  }
}

```
