## Review

Great job! You just learned about numerical data types and how to work with numerical data in a few different ways:

* Use arithmetic operators to write expressions.
* Combine operators together to write more concise programs.
* Use the modulo operator (%) to find remainders.
* Use built-in methods to do more complex math.
* Use documentation to look new things up.

Now that you know a few ways of working with numbers, try writing some small programs that use what you learned in this lesson. Some ideas:

* Write a program that calculates compound interest
* Write a program that finds your age in dog years
* What other program ideas can you come up with?

## Instructions

Time for some practice! Use the code editor to play around with what you learned in this lesson. If youâ€™re not sure what to do, try one of the extensions above!

```c#
using System;

namespace Review
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      /* use this space to write your own short program! 
      Here's what you learned:

      DATA TYPES: int, double
      ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: +, -, *, /
      INCREMENT/DECREMENT: ++, --
      MODULO: % 
      BUILT-IN METHODS: Abs, Pow, Sqrt, Floor, Ceiling, Min, Max

      Good luck! */

    }
  }
}
