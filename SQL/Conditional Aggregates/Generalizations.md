CONDITIONAL AGGREGATES<br>

Generalizations

Congratulations! You just learned about Conditional Aggregates in SQL. What can we generalize so far?

* Conditional Aggregates are aggregate functions the compute a result set based on a given set of conditions.
* NULL can be used to denote an empty field value
* CASE statements allow for custom classification of data
* CASE statements can be used inside aggregates (like SUM() and COUNT()) to provide filtered measures
