SET OPERATIONS<br>

Generalizations

Congratulations! We just learned about Set Operations in SQL. What can we generalize so far?

* The UNION clause allows us to utilize information from multiple tables in our queries.
* The UNION ALL clause allows us to utilize information from multiple tables in our queries, including duplicate values.
* INTERSECT is used to combine two SELECT statements, but returns rows only from the first SELECT statement that are identical to a row in the second SELECT statement.
* EXCEPT returns distinct rows from the first SELECT statement that arenâ€™t output by the second SELECT statement
