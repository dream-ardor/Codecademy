Classes: Instance Variables

When we create a new class, we probably have specific details that we want the class to include. We save those specific details into instance variables.

Here is an instance variable in the Car class that describes a detail that we might want to associate with a car:
```java
class Car {

    //Using instance variables to model our Car class after a real-life car
    int modelYear;

    public Car() {

    }
}
```
In the example above, we created the instance variable named modelYear. Instance variables model real-world car attributes, such as the model year of a car. Finally, the instance variable is represented by the int data type.

**Instructions:**
Let's model the Dog class after a real-world dog. Create an int instance variable called age.

**My Code:**
```java
class Dog {

int age;
public Dog() {
  
}

public static void main(String[] args) {

	}
}
```
