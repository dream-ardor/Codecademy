## LEARN JAVA: VARIABLES

### String

So far, we have learned primitive data types, which are the simplest types of data with no built-in behavior. Our programs will also use Strings, which are objects, instead of primitives. Objects have built-in behavior.

Strings hold sequences of characters. Weâ€™ve already seen instances of a String, for example when you printed out "Hello World".

Just like with a primitive, we declare the variable by specifying the type first:

String greeting = "Hello World";

### Instructions

Create a variable called openingLyrics that holds "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away".

Call System.out.println() to print out openingLyrics.

## My Code
```java
public class Song {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
String openingLyrics = "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away";
    System.out.println(openingLyrics);
	}
}
```
