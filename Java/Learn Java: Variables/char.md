## LEARN JAVA: VARIABLES

### char

How do we answer questions like: What grade did you get on the test? What letter does your name start with?

The char data type can hold any character, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark.

It must be surrounded by single quotes, '.

For example:
```java
char grade = 'A';
char firstLetter = 'p';
char punctuation = '!';
```

### Instructions

Create a variable called expectedGrade of type char.

Fill it with a single letter, representing the grade you think you would get in a graded Java course where the grades A, B, C, D and F are possible.

Print out your expectedGrade variable!

## My Code
```java
public class Char {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
 char expectedGrade = 'A';
    System.out.println(expectedGrade);
	}
}
```
