## LEARN JAVA: VARIABLES

### Review

Creating and filling variables is a powerful concept that allow us to keep track of all kinds of data in our program.

In this lesson, we learned how to create and print several different datatypes in Java, which youâ€™ll use as you create bigger and more complex programs.

We covered:

* ints, which store whole numbers
* doubles, which store bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers
* booleans, which store true and false
* chars, which store single characters using single quotes.
* Strings, which store multiple characters using double quotes.
* Static typing, which is one of the safety features of Java
* Variable naming conventions.

Practice declaring variables and assigning values to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!

### Instructions

The file MyProfile.java contains a class that represents your hiring profile as presented to potential employers.

In the main() method, create a variable called name that holds your name, as a sequence of characters.

Create a variable called age that holds your age as a whole number.

Create a variable called desiredSalary that holds your desired salary per year to a precision of two decimal points.

Create a variable called gender that holds a single character, m (male), f (female), n (for none), or o (for other).

Create a variable called lookingForJob that holds whether or not you are currently open to job offers.

## My Code
```java
public class MyProfile {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
 String name = "Dan";
    int age = 39;
    double desiredSalary = 180000;
    char gender = 'm';
    boolean lookingForJob = true;
	}
}
```
