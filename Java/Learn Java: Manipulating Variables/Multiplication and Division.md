## LEARN JAVA: MANIPULATING VARIABLES

### Multiplication and Division

Letâ€™s say that our employer is calculating our paycheck and depositing it to our bank account. We worked 40 hours last week, at a rate of 15.50 an hour. Java can calculate this with the multiplication operator *:
```java
double paycheckAmount = 40 * 15.50;
//paycheckAmount now holds 620.0
```
If we want to see how many hours our total balance represents, we use the division operator /:
```java
double balance = 20010.5;
double hourlyRate = 15.5;
double hoursWorked = balance / hourlyRate;
//hoursWorked now holds 1291.0
```
Division has different results with integers. The / operator does integer division, which means that any remainder is lost.
```java
int evenlyDivided = 10 / 5;
//evenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 5 is 2
int unevenlyDivided = 10 / 4;
//unevenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 4 is 2.5
```
evenlyDivided stores what you expect, but unevenlyDivided holds 2 because ints cannot store decimals!

Java removes the 0.5 to fit the result into an int type!

### Instructions

In main(), there is a variable called subtotal, which represents the subtotal of an amount to pay on a bill, and a variable called tax, which represents the amount of tax added to the subtotal.

Create a double variable, total, that holds subtotal plus the product of subtotal and tax.

Print the total variable!

There were 4 people who bought this meal together and want to split the cost.

Create a double variable called perPerson that holds total divided by 4.

## My Code
```java
public class MultAndDivide {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double subtotal = 30;
    double tax = 0.0875;
    double total = subtotal + (subtotal*tax);
    System.out.println(total);
    
    double perPerson = total / 4;
    System.out.println(perPerson);
	}
}
```

Print the perPerson variable!
