## LEARN JAVA: MANIPULATING VARIABLES

### .equals()

So far, we’ve only been using operations on primitive types. It doesn’t make much sense to multiply Strings, or see if one String is less than the other. But what if we had two users logging into a site, and we wanted to see if their usernames were the same?

With Objects, such as Strings, we can’t use the primitive equality operator. To test equality with Strings, we use a built-in method called .equals().

To use it, we call it on one String, by using ., and pass in the String to compare against in parentheses:
```java
String person1 = "Paul";
String person2 = "John";
String person3 = "Paul";

System.out.println(person1.equals(person2));
//prints false, since "Paul" is not "John"

System.out.println(person1.equals(person3));
//prints true, since "Paul" is "Paul"
````
### Instructions

We have three lines from a song in Song.java.

First, print out whether line1 and line2 are the same.

Now, print whether line2 and line3 are equal.

## My Code
```java
public class Song {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      String line1 = "Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah";
      String line2 = "Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude";
      String line3 = "Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude";
      System.out.println(line1.equals(line2));
      System.out.println(line2.equals(line3));
    }       
}

```
