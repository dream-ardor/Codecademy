**LOOPS**<br>

Looping over a dictionary<br>

You may be wondering how looping over a dictionary would work. Would you get the key or the value?

The short answer is: you get the key which you can use to get the value.

**Instructions:**

On line 5, print the key, followed by a space, followed by the value associated with that key.


**MY CODE:**
```python
d = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'berry', 'c': 'cherry'}

for key in d:
 print key, d[key] # Your code here!
 ```
