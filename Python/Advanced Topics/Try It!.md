All right! Time to test out filter() and lambda expressions.

cubes = [x ** 3 for x in range(1, 11)]
filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, cubes)
The example above is just a reminder of the syntax.

**Instructions:**
Create a list, squares, that consists of the squares of the numbers 1 to 10. A list comprehension could be useful here!

Use filter() and a lambda expression to print out only the squares that are between 30 and 70 (inclusive).

**My Code:**
```python
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1,11)]
print filter(lambda x: x >= 30 and x <=70, squares)
```
