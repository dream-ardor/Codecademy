Iterating Over Dictionaries<br>
First, let's review iterating over a dict.

**Instructions:**
Call the appropriate method on movies such that it will print out all the items (hint, hint) in the dictionaryâ€”that is, each key and each value.

**My Code:**
```python
movies = {
  "Monty Python and the Holy Grail": "Great",
  "Monty Python's Life of Brian": "Good",
  "Monty Python's Meaning of Life": "Okay"
}

print movies.items()
```
