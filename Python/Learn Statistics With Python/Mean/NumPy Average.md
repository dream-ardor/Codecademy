### NumPy Average

While you've shown that you can calculate the average yourself, it becomes time-consuming as the size of your dataset increases — imagine adding all of the numbers in a dataset with 10,000 observations.

The NumPy .average() function can do the work of adding and dividing for you. In the example below, we use np.average() to calculate the average of a dataset with ten values:
```python
example_array = np.array([24, 16, 30, 10, 12, 28, 38, 2, 4, 36])

example_average = np.average(example_array)

print(example_average)
```
The code above calculates the average of example_array and saves the value to example_average. The resulting average of this array is 20.

### Instructions

Use NumPy to calculate the average value of the author_ages array. Save the result to average_age.

Does the average age of the authors surprise you? If so, how? Is it older, or younger than you expected?

## My Code
```python
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read author data
greatest_books = pd.read_csv("top-hundred-books.csv")

# Set author ages to a NumPy array
author_ages = greatest_books['Ages']

# Use numpy to calculate the average age of the top 100 authors
average_age = np.average(author_ages)

print("The average age of the 100 greatest authors, according to a survey by Le Monde, is: " + str(average_age))
```
