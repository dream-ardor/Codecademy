**LOOPS**<br>

For your strings:<br>

Using a for loop, you can print out each individual character in a string.

The example in the editor is almost plain English: "for each character c in thing, print c".

**MY CODE:**
```python
thing = "spam!"

for c in thing:
  print c

word = "eggs!"

# Your code here!
for d in word:
  print d
  ```
