LEARN PYTHON: SYNTAX

Review

In this lesson, we accomplished a lot of things! We instructed our computers to print messages, we stored these messages as variables, and we learned to update those messages depending on the part of the program we were in. We performed mathematical calculations and explored some of the mathematical expressions that Python offers us. We learned about errors and other valuable skills that will continue to serve us as we develop our programming skills.

Good job!

**Instructions:**
Create variables my_age, half_my_age, greeting, name, and greeting_with_name. Assign values to each using your knowledge of division and concatenation!

**My Code:**
```py
my_age = 38
half_my_age = my_age / 2
greeting = "Hello " 
name = "Dan"
greeting_with_name = greeting + name + "!"

print(half_my_age)
print(greeting_with_name)
```
