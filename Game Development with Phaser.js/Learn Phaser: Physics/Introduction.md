## Building a Phaser game with Physics

“I wonder if my character will make that jump…” - Every gamer ever.

Figuring out the rules of a video game is a one of the joys of starting a new game. We wonder how fast our character can go, or how high it jumps, or what happens when it touches an enemy sprite. As a game developer, implementing these rules is about deciding the physics of our game. The physics of a game determines how GameObjects interact with the game world.

In this lesson, we’ll be using one of Phaser’s built-in physics plugin to create a game with set rules and interactions!

## Instructions

We’ll be constructing the game in the browser. Go ahead and test it out. Control the player sprite using left and right arrow keys to avoid the falling bugs!
