## Review: Credits

Throughout this lesson you learned many ways to polish the effects in Phaser games, we’ve added:

* Cameras
* Special Camera Effects (Fade Out and Shake)
* Particle Emitters
* Tinted Sprites
* Parallax Scrolling
* What an incredible series of good looking features our game has now!

Now that our game is looking fabulous, let’s make a little credits scene together with Codey sledding!

## Instructions

We’ve added in a Credits scene after the fourth level, featuring Codey sledding away to safety. Use your skills with effects to add in a background, and make sure to put your name in there, congratulations on an amazing game!
