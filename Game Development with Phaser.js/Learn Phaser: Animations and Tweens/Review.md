You did wonderful work with animations and tweens!

In this lesson, you learned how about:

* The difference between an image and a sprite sheet.
* Loading in sprite sheets.
* Creating animations.
* Playing animations.
* Flipping animations.
* Pausing animations
* Using and creating tweens.
* Adding a callback to a tween.
* Using these techniques, you can make your games even more visually appealing!

To challenge yourself:

* Create a jump animation for Codey.
* Add more tween callbacks, make use of onStart.
* Provide gameState.exit with a tween.
* Create another level (Scene) with new animations and tweens.
