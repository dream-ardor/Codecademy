## Review

Congratulations! You made your first game, Color a Pegasus! Over the course of this lesson you created the sequence of event handlers to:

    Own and update the state of the game.
    Update the color of specific parts of the pegasus in the game
    Highlight GameObjects to indicate what will be clicked on

Youâ€™ve dispalyed a lot of control over the possible mouse cursor events and successfully used that control to build a coloring game! Good job!
